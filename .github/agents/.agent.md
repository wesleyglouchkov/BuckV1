# Agent Development Guidelines

- Do NOT create `index.ts` barrel files for component exports. Import components directly from their file paths.
- Keep files flat and explicit: `import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";` not from `@/components/ui`.
- Prefer single-responsibility files. One component per file.
- Use TypeScript with strict types.
- Client components must start with "use client" and avoid server-only APIs.
- Server components should not import client-only libraries.
- Dont use <span> when two things need to be shown in one row 
- Dont create page_new.tsx just randomly 
- Styling:
  - No rounded corners for inputs and buttons.
  - Use blue focus ring: `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary/50 focus:ring-offset-2`.
  - Buttons and inputs must have square edges.
- Auth:
  - Layouts use `await auth()` (server-side) for session.
  - Avoid role redirects during local testing; use middleware toggles.
  - use axios.ts for wrapper for client calls
  export const createClientAuthInstance = async ( role?: string) => {
    return axios.create({
        baseURL: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL || 'http://localhost:8000'}/api`,
        withCredentials: true, // Always include cookies for authentication
        headers: {
            ...(role && { 'role': role }),
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
    });
};

- Dark Mode:
  - Persist theme in `localStorage` key `buck-theme`.
  - Initialize theme early in `app/layout.tsx` via inline script.
  - Use shadcn `Switch` with gray off-state and black on-state.
- Toasts: Use Sonner positioned bottom-right.
- Icons: Use `lucide-react`.
- Avoid over-abstracting shared exports; prefer explicit imports.
- Do not modify build tasks without approval.

## Import Examples
- Correct: `import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";`
- Incorrect: `import { Input } from "@/components/ui";` (barrel export)

## File Naming
- Use kebab-case for for components.
- 

## Commit Etiquette
- Keep commits small and descriptive.
- Reference affected files in the message.
